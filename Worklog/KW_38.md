####Monday
I was working on the User Stories and thinking about how i want to develop the game and what the biggest problems might be.

####Tuesday
I created a new Java Project in Eclipse and a Folder-Hierarchy. Also i decided to go with the MVC-Pattern (Model, View, Controller). Then i started to code the UI, at first a JFrame and then some JPanels with UI-Elements inside. 

####Wednesday
I worked further on the UI to display the grid. After that i started to create the Model for the Player, Board and Pieces. 

####Thursday
Today i was thinking a lot about the problem of scalable node initialization and i came up with a great idea which creates every "Rectangle" of Nodes of the playboard accordingly to the last created node. :) pretty sweet. after that i just needed to add the middle-nodes from the already created nodeSets to the new Nodesets (for the lines between the squares).

TODO


insert picture of thoughts to describe the stuff


TODO

I created a function which describes the Set of all Nodes and also puts them into NodeSets, used for checking for closed mills later on.
